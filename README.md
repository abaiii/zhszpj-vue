# zhszpj-vue

## Introduction
`zhszpj` stands for `ZongHe SuZhi PingJia`, the pinyin of "综合素质评价" (Comprehensive Quality Evaluation), a system widely used to assess - as in the name - the comprehensive qualities of the student by (1) teachers updating the achievements made by students and (2) students updating their summaries and stuff onto that system.

The aim of creating this repo and `zhszpj-backend` is mainly to create a usable `zhszpj` system. This repo contains the frontend stuff.
